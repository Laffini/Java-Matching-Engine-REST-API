# Java-Matching-Engine REST API

![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/Laffini/Java-Matching-Engine-REST-API/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Maven/badge.svg)

A matching engine written in Java.

## What is a matching engine?

A matching engine matches buy and sell orders in a market.

## Matching Algorithm

The matching engine uses a price-time-priority algorithm.
The matching priority is firstly price, then time.
Market participants are rewarded for offering the best price and coming early. 

## Usage

It is recommended that every user of this service audits and verifies all underlying code for its validity and suitability. Mistakes and bugs happen.

To use this project, you will need to include the 'core' and 'restapi' packages as part of your Spring configuration scanning (as seen below).
```
@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {"net.laffyco.javamatchingengine.core", "net.laffyco.javamatchingengine.restapi"})
public class ExampleApp {

    public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ExampleApp.class, args);
    }

}
```


## Usage Examples

### Buying and Selling Example

#### Creating a maker order

User A creates a buy order of 2 items (e.g. 2 shares, 2 bitcoin, etc) with a price of 5 (e.g. Â£5, $5, etc)

##### Request

```
POST /api/v1/order/
		?side=BUY
		&amount=2
		&price=5
``` 
##### Response

```
{
  "trades": [],
  "id": "02923822-070b-448d-9240-f3623f90927a"
}
```

A unique ID is generated for the order (so that it can be modified/viewed).
 A list of trades is also returned.
 In this example the list of trades returned is empty as no trades have been made (due to the order book being empty).

#### Creating a taker order

User B creates a sell order of 2 items with a price of 5.

##### Request

```
POST api/v1//order/
		?side=SELL
		&amount=2
		&price=5
``` 

##### Response

```
{
  "trades": [
    {
      "takerOrderId": "12964731-2cd4-401b-ac8d-3853f58f75c0",
      "makerOrderId": "02923822-070b-448d-9240-f3623f90927a",
      "amount": 2,
      "price": 5
    }
  ],
  "id": "12964731-2cd4-401b-ac8d-3853f58f75c0"
}
```

As the sell order matches the buy order created earlier we can see that a trade has taken place.
